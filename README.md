EliteDangerousCrosshair v.1.1
=======================

Crosshair for Elite Dangerous to assist with piloting in Frameshift Mode/Docking

Rewrote to deal with some FPS issues.

Original code at https://github.com/RobCubed/EliteDangerousCrosshair_original


========================

v1.1 Changes:

- Optimized FPS loss (slower refresh rate, which is unnecessary unless you are moving or resizing the window)
- Added reticle size slider
- Added line thickness options
- Changed from a console window to a nicer looking form window
